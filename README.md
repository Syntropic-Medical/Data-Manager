## Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration. To set up your environment:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file and fill in your configuration values:
   ```
   # Data Manager Environment Variables
   
   # Flask Secret Key
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   
   # reCAPTCHA Keys
   RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY=your_recaptcha_public_key
   RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_recaptcha_private_key
   
   # Email Configuration
   SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email@example.com
   SENDER_EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
   
   # Claude API Key
   CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key
   ```

3. Make sure to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. The application will automatically load these environment variables at startup.

**Note:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already added to `.gitignore`.
